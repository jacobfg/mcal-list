# mcal

A simple script for listing macOS built-in calendar app from command line.

It's a stripped down version of [https://github.com/0ihsan/mcal](https://github.com/0ihsan/mcal) with some features I needed to use with sketchybar

```sh
swiftc Sources/main.swift && mv main mcal-list && gh release create 0.0.2 mcal-list
```
